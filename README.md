How I built this application

1. Used openapi generator to convert yml to spring-boot application
2. Added business logic to handle http requests in spring-boot controllers
3. Deployed docker image to GCP Artifcat Registry
4. Created k8s cluster on GCP project and deployed containers and load balancer using helm chart
